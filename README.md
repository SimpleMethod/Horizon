# 📡Horizon - Meteorological System based on Internet of things

![Horizon in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimpleMethod/Horizon/master/doc/Horizon.jpg)

# 🧗‍♂️Main milestones

1. Development of a device for measuring atmospheric conditions.
2. Development of a device for receiving telemetry and sending it to IoT server. 
3. Development of an IoT server able to collect data and analyse.
4. Development of an instrument for wind direction mapping.  

# 🚀 Features
 1. Getting meteorological data such as:
 - Air temperature,
 - Atmospheric pressure,
- Air humidity,
- Soil moisture,
- Wind direction,
- Dust value 2.5 PM and 10 PM.
2.  Communication between weather stations and base stations using IEEE 802.11 standard.
3.  Sending received data to IoT server via GSM communication from base stations.
4.  Ability to view data via a graphical interface from any device.
5. IoT server aggregating and analyzing data. 

# 🗺️ Technologies used in project 
1. Weather station:
- Based on two microcontainers:  STM32 and ESP32 programmed in C++. Development of necessary libraries based on technical documentation,
- Used LTC415 as voltage monitor,
- Photovoltaic panels,
- Voltage regulator,
- Gel rechargeable battery.
2. Receiving station:
- Used ESP32  programmed in C++. Development of necessary libraries based on technical documentation,
- Used SIM700e as GSM modem.
3. IoT server:
-  Based completely on AWS services (AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, API gateway)
- Graphical interface based on AngularJS
